TRANSFORMATION

To acomplish the 2-5 csv mandatories for the project, is necessary to compact the "pobmun" of each year into a big one. For that operation, we could do it manually, but is better to apply a transformation from the raw data.

1. Since there is the year in each of the csvs, a column should be added to identify each municipality in each year, also this decision is made because it will help to match the format with the "death_causes_province" and the "economic_sector_province"
